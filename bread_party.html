        <h3>Our Goals</h3>
        <p><strong>Economic Reform:</strong> We believe in a fair and robust economy where every citizen has the opportunity to succeed. Our economic policies aim to support small businesses, ensure job opportunities, and create a sustainable financial future.</p>

        <p><strong>Gun Control:</strong> Safety is our priority. We advocate for responsible gun control laws that balance individual rights with public safety. Our approach focuses on common-sense regulations, background checks, and reducing gun violence in communities.</p>

        <p><strong>Immigration Reform:</strong> We envision an immigration system that respects human rights and allows people from diverse backgrounds to contribute to our nation. Our goal is to create a streamlined, fair process that benefits both immigrants and our country.</p>
